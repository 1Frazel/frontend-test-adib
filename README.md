# A Challenge

Hello and thanks for trying out with us!

You find here a few tests. They are composed of some basic yet a bit challenging things we had to do on the job.
They will allow you to have a glimpse of the work with us and see if that's interesting to you.
They'll also provide us with insights of your working style.

## Submission

You have 2 days to complete the challenge. Though realistically, this shouldn't take you more than 4 hours.

Please fork this and once you complete, send us back the forked link to harsha@99.co, co@99.co & alexandre.biediger@99.co

## Questions

### React

1. Hide description until the button is clicked
2. Because of SEO we want to only hide description after page load
3. Anonymize all phone numbers: first 4 numbers visible, replace following 4 with X (e.g. 8111 XXXX or 8123 XXXX)
   Note Singapore phone number format is always 8 numbers long.
   See [Number Ranges on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Singapore#Number_ranges) for precise rules.
4. Line returns in the text should be displayed on page
5. Clicking on phone number reveals the real number
